CRAssist ‚Äì Class Representative Assistance System
üöÄ Project Overview
CRAssist is a role-based web application integrated with the college's student information system, designed to streamline communication, task coordination, feedback collection, and notifications among students, teachers, and administrators. The system automates class representative duties to enhance classroom efficiency and engagement, providing a seamless experience for all users involved.

This project will implement a full DevOps pipeline for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), containerized deployments, secure secrets management, real-time monitoring, and a scalable infrastructure using Kubernetes.

‚ú® Key Features
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated code integration and deployment.

Containerization: Docker containers for easy and consistent application deployment.

Kubernetes: Orchestrates and manages containers at scale.

Monitoring: Real-time system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

Security: Uses Vault for secrets management and AWS IAM for access control.

Scalable Infrastructure: Fully scalable using Kubernetes, ensuring high availability.

üõ† Tools & Technologies
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Terraform: Automates cloud infrastructure provisioning.

Ansible: Manages configuration and software provisioning.

CI/CD:

GitHub Actions: Automates building, testing, and deploying the application.

Containerization:

Docker: Containerizes the frontend, backend, and database.

Kubernetes: Manages and scales the containers.

Testing:

Postman: For API testing and automation.

SonarQube: For static code analysis and quality assurance.

Monitoring:

Prometheus: Collects system metrics and triggers alerts.

Grafana: Visualizes system performance and health.

Security:

HashiCorp Vault: Secures and manages sensitive credentials.

AWS IAM (or equivalent): Manages role-based access control.

üèó Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CRAssist.git
cd CRAssist
Install dependencies:

If using npm:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Or if using Yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn install
Set up environment variables:

Copy .env.example to .env and configure the necessary values.

Dockerize the application:
Run the app in a Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up
Deploy on Kubernetes:
Use Kubernetes to deploy the containers to your local or cloud-based Kubernetes cluster.

üîÑ Workflow
Development: Developers push code to GitHub, triggering automated tests and builds.

CI Pipeline: GitHub Actions runs tests, checks for code quality with SonarQube, and builds the Docker containers.

Deployment: After passing tests, the containers are deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

Monitoring: Prometheus collects metrics, and Grafana visualizes the health and performance of the app in real-time.

Security: Vault ensures that sensitive data is securely managed and accessed only by authorized users.
